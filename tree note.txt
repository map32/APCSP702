root

parent

child

nodes can have a most 1 parent.
nodes can have many children

full vs balanced

full tree has equal levels of children

	.	.	O	.	.
	.	O		O	.
	O	O		O	O
O		O		O		O

balanced: all subtrees heights differ by no more than 1
	  and all subtrees are balanced.

impleplantation

  node
  -data
  -left
  -right

  tree
  -root
  -add(log n operation)
  -remove(value)
  -adding and removing are log n time

  add impleplantation xDDDD
  - add(treenode<t> branch, t data)
  - add(t data)

ways to read through the elements in a tree
  
preordered = VClCr
	     root first, left child then right child
postorder = ClCrV
	    left child, right child then root
inorder = ClVCr
	  left child, root, right child
